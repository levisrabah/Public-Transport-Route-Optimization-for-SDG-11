# Disease Outbreak Prediction: SDG 3 â€“ Good Health and Well-being

## SDG Problem Addressed
This project addresses SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being by predicting disease outbreaks using health and environmental data. Early prediction of outbreaks enables timely interventions, resource allocation, and supports public health decision-making.

## ML Approach Used
- **Type:** Supervised Learning
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Features:** Temperature, humidity, population density, previous cases
- **Target:** Outbreak occurrence (yes/no)

## Results
- **Accuracy:** ~85% (on synthetic demonstration data)
- **F1 Score:** ~0.78
- **Key Predictors:** Temperature and population density were most important for prediction.
- **Visualization:** Confusion matrix and feature importance plots provided.

## Ethical Considerations
- **Bias:** Data may underrepresent rural or low-income regions, potentially reducing prediction accuracy for these areas.
- **Fairness:** The model includes diverse features and regions to promote fairness. Regular checks for bias are recommended.
- **Sustainability:** Early outbreak prediction helps allocate resources efficiently, saving lives and reducing costs, thus supporting sustainable health systems.
